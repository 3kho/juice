### **How would you pitch your game in one line?**

It's like Stardew Valley meets a glowing labyrinth, where farming bioluminescent plants unlock new areas in a dark, mysterious world.

### **What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

The key mechanic of Glow Grove is farming bioluminescent plants to light up the dark world and unlock hidden areas. Each plant emits light of varying intensity and (customisable) colour, which expands the visible world, attracts glowing creatures, and reveals rare resources (glowing crystals, streams).

As players advance, they can:

- Discover new species of plants with unique glowing properties.
- Strategically place plants to maximize light coverage while maintaining beauty.
- Interact with glowing animals that provide or lead to critical resources (like following them leads to a glowing stream), creating a dynamic ecosystem.

Finding hidden secrets, along with the beautiful glowing landscapes will make the gameplay enjoyable.

### **How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

Players start with a single seed that produces faint light, growing plants to increase the light radius and reveal more of the world. As light spreads, they uncover new areas, rare seeds, and bioluminescent animals, unlocking upgrades to grow more plants, improve light output, and transform the land. Glowing animals aid in farming through pollination or resource generation while balancing the ecosystem ensures plants thrive and animals stay attracted. Players can use animals to drive away pests, like moths, which decrease the light output of plants. Resources are used to enhance tools, acquire rare seeds, and unlock advanced areas, while puzzles requiring specific light colours or patterns challenge the player to progress further.

### **How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes?**

Players will consistently unlock new areas, plants, and animals, creating a rewarding loop of discovery. They will encounter new challenges, such as foggy areas that block light and creatures like moths that can obstruct or consume light. This situation will require careful planning. Players can express their creativity by strategically placing plants and animals, experimenting with various glowing designs for their farms, and altering the colours and layout of their glowing groves. As they develop their farms, players will enjoy stunning glowing visuals, that create a feeling of success and keep them engaged through discovery and visual rewards.
