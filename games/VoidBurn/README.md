### **How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It is most likely be having a story with LOL fights or somewhat particals of fortnite and may be pillagers..

### **What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
It gonna have a character which will have some story for intro and to know everything else like how the weapon gonna work, or this weapon can attack down enemy in just two attacks, I'll try if I can add a online multi-player(but my pc sucks, yep in godot too). for fun aspect, It'll have story based fun or may be the character playing with some other ppl..(fighting with other ppl)


### **How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The players are or our characters will be going in fight to help(after the intro scene and some story..) some ppl in danger and since the characters won't have their own family they'll kinda start liking that they can literally get so much gold going to somewhere and attacking them, and the game converts to; less story, more fight/logic/strategy and this logic/strategy loop continuos


### **How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
- first the intro/story
- and the weapons training and all
- then, comes the first fight
- then, some more story based on win/loss
- the story/game continuos based on the success or lose of the fight, they'll also lose ppl.
- and some things which I haven't thought of yet..
