Who am I?
One guy that has way too much time, i used unity for 2 years and a lot of python recently, with also some glsl and sql. I would love to go to China, because I like to experience different cultures and languages.
I also was part of high seas and made a game engine from scratch with python and glsl.
I live in France.

The team?
Me and my dog (this is obviously a joke because dogs can’t program you silly!).

The project?
A game made with godot (never used it before, brackeys please save me).
You are in charge of managing a train going from cities to other villages to transport people, you need to manage the train tracks so that it doesn’t arrive late!
You must also be aware of your level of coal and be ready for dysfonctionnements.
You will be able to buy upgardes, like coal space, new wagon, speed...
And train tracks!

Core game Loop?
You win money as people embarque on the train / loose money if you are late
You buy train tracks/upgrades...
More people arrive with new cities
You rewire your traintrack system

Goal?
The goal of the game is to hold for as long as possible, with time new cities will appear with more people, you will have to optimize your tracks, coal refuels and speed.

Maybe?
- CO2 and O2 => the train will leave some pollution
- to get rid of it => buy trees or change your fuel
