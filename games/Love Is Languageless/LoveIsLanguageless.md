### How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)

1. **Start at the Trailhead:** Players embark on a path representing their kingdom's journey, with levels unlocked by completing mini-games.

2. **Mini-Games:**
   - **Zen Garden:** Players arrange objects (stones, plants, water) to restore harmony and earn coins for successful placements.
   - **Tower Strategist:** Players defend their kingdom by placing towers to stop waves of enemies trying to steal resources.
   - **Treasure Hunt:** Players explore a grid to uncover treasures and avoid traps, earning prosperity points for their kingdom.

3. **Build and Upgrade Village:** Coins earned from mini-games are used to develop and protect the kingdom’s resources.

4. **Repeat and Explore:** Players choose between following the trail’s main progression or replaying their favorite games for extra rewards.

2. **Progression System:** A visible trail and unlockable village upgrades encourage continued play.

3. **Replayability:** Players can replay mini-games to maximize rewards and customize their journey.
