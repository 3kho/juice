### How would you pitch your game in one line?

"It's like **Duolingo** meets **Clash of Clans** but with a **language-less, interconnected AR treasure hunt, Zen Garden, and Tower Defense twist!"

### What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?

**1. Interconnected Mini-Games:** Each of the three games (Zen Garden, Tower Strategist, Treasure Hunt) is interconnected, creating a larger village-building narrative. Success in one game directly impacts the others by adding resources, harmony, or defense.

**2. Freedom of Choice:** Players can follow the guided progression trail or use earned coins to replay their favorite mini-games and customize their journey.

**3. Visual Progression and Feedback:** A glowing trail shows advancement, while the evolving village reflects the player's success, creating a tangible sense of achievement.

### How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)

1. **Start at the Trailhead:** Players embark on a path representing their kingdom's journey, with levels unlocked by completing mini-games.

2. **Mini-Games:**

   - **Tower Strategist:** Players defend their kingdom by placing towers to stop waves of enemies trying to steal resources.
   - **Treasure Hunt:** Players explore a grid to uncover treasures and avoid traps, earning prosperity points for their kingdom.

3. **Build and Upgrade Village:** Coins earned from mini-games are used to develop and protect the kingdom’s resources.

4. **Repeat and Explore:** Players choose between following the trail’s main progression or replaying their favorite games for extra rewards.
