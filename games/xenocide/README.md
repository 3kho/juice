# Xenocide

**Team Members:** [Jack Gendill, Owen Borgos]

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Like if source physics, Ultrakill, and SuperHot all were in an unhappy relationship.
**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The game's speed will be adjusted by your playstyle in real time. The enemies will also be fully interactible, with the character being able to pick up and use the enemies as a shield against projectiles, or a projectile themselves.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
They will be tasked in slaughtering hordes of enemies, but due to budget cuts, will be forced to use underpowered, old equipment. They will use the equipment given to find solutions 

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
