**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Its like My Talking Angela, but not a virtual pet game ,a virtual YOU game. You control your life as a teenager and balance your study and chill  life!!

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
You choose your Avatar whos JUST LIKE YOU. 
At the start of each game day, you have to select a chill day or productive day. Then the game assigns you tasks accordingly.
With each mini task completed for your virtual character's well being(and yes chillin is a part too) you gain XP.
The goal is to maintain the balance between chilling and working towards your goals, with each week of good balance maintained you level up.

The game is fun because it lets you do stuff which you may not be able to do in your real life, it promotes well being and the importance of balance
in a teenager's life. It also shows that it isnt really that hard to be "THAT KID" .With the cozy game experience anyone is sure to enjoy playing it
and maybe even implement it in their life!  ;)

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The main-game starts with you choosing avatar and type of day. Mini tasks in the game have various controls like drag-drop, click, swipe ,etc.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Each game day is of 10 minutes. The tasks assigned for chill/productive day keep you occupied . 
Tasks get harder with each passing day but your efficiency also increases.
Tasks are related to working out, cooking, studying,co-curriculars on productive days and hobbies/travel/eat/self-care on chill days.
If the balance of work/play is maintained for 7 game days,
you get to level up to unlock new tasks and new outfits for your avatar!
